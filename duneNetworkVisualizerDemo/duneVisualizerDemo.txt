This is the initial software package comprising a few scripts which together are a rough demo of the network performance measurement tool our team has been working on in accordance with OSU's participation in the Deep Underground Neutrino Project.

Instructions:

1) Place raw JSON files containing the RUCIO output of file transfer logs in the raw folder

2) Run "python newline_remover.py raw data" 
the 1st parameter being the folder containing the raw JSON files and the second parameter being the folder where the script should output the concatonated JSON.

3) Next run the script "json_parse_spike.py" and supply the parameter of the path and latest named data file in the "data" folder, something like "python json_parse_spike.py ./data/2020_12_07_07_02_01.json"

4) Finally run the visualization script supplying the parameter of output file in the output directory and a new browser window will open with an interactive visualization of the network transfers. Example "python readJsonAndVisualize.py 2020_12_07_07_02_01_output.json"


*** Alternatively ***

If the data has already been generated and is still there from last time you can skip to part 4.
